Question:
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:
What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.
For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

# Code:

def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
    if len(haystack) != 0 and len(needle) != 0:
        if needle in haystack:
            index_needle = haystack.index(needle)
            return index_needle
            
        else:
                
            index_needle = -1
                
            return index_needle
        
    elif len(haystack) == 0 and len(needle) != 0:
        index_needle = -1
        return index_needle
        
    else:
        index_needle = 0
        return index_needle
